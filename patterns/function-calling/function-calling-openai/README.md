# Function Calling (Tools): OpenAI

Function calling via OpenAI.

## OpenAI

The application consumes models from the [OpenAI](https://openai.com) platform.

### Create an account

Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and sign up for a new account.

### Configure API Key

In the OpenAI console, navigate to _Dashboard > API Keys_ and generate a new API key.
Copy and securely store your API key on your machine as an environment variable.
The application will use it to access the OpenAI API.

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR-API-KEY>
```

## Running the application

Run the application.

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Calling the application

> [!NOTE]
> These examples use the [httpie](https://httpie.io) CLI to send HTTP requests.

Call the application that will use a chat model to answer your question.

```shell
http :8080/chat/function authorName=="J.R.R. Tolkien" -b
```

```shell
http :8080/chat/function/list bookTitle1=="Narnia" bookTitle2=="The Hobbit" -b
```

Try again. This time, the function calling strategy is configured in the call at runtime.

```shell
http :8080/chat/function/explicit authorName=="Philip Pullman" -b
```

Next, try the method calling strategy.

```shell
http :8080/chat/method/no-args -b
```

```shell
http :8080/chat/method/void user=="Jessica" -b
```

```shell
http :8080/chat/method/single authorName=="J.R.R. Tolkien" -b
```

```shell
http :8080/chat/method/single authorName=="C.S. Lewis" -b
```

```shell
http :8080/chat/method/list bookTitle1=="Narnia" bookTitle2=="The Hobbit" -b
```

```shell
http :8080/chat/method/non-public authorName=="C.S. Lewis" -b
```
