# Function Calling: OpenAI

Function calling via OpenAI.

## OpenAI

The application relies on the OpenAI API for providing LLMs.

### Create an OpenAI account

Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and sign up for a new account.

### Configure API Key

In the OpenAI console, navigate to _Dashboard > API Keys_ and generate a new API key.
Copy and securely store your API key on your machine as an environment variable.
The application will use it to access the OpenAI API.

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR-API-KEY>
```

## Running the application

Run the application.

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Calling the application

Call the application that will use a chat model to answer your question.

```shell
http :8080/chat/function authorName=="J.R.R. Tolkien" -b
```

Try again. This time, the function calling strategy is configured in the call at runtime.

```shell
http :8080/chat/function/explicit authorName=="Philip Pullman" -b
```
