# JSON Document Readers: Ollama

Reading and vectorizing JSON documents with LLMs via Ollama.

## Ollama

The application consumes models from an [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) inference server. You can either run Ollama locally on your laptop, or let Arconia provide a Dev Service that will run Ollama as a container automatically.

Either way, Spring AI will take care of pulling the needed Ollama models when the application starts, if they are not available yet on your machine.

## Running the application

Run the application as follows:

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

Under the hood, in case no native Ollama connection is detected on your machine, the Arconia framework will automatically spin up an [Ollama](https://arconia.io/docs/arconia/latest/dev-services/ollama/) inference service using Testcontainers (see [Arconia Dev Services](https://arconia.io/docs/arconia/latest/dev-services/) for more information).

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

## Calling the application

> [!NOTE]
> These examples use the [httpie](https://httpie.io) CLI to send HTTP requests.

Call the application that will perform a semantic search based on your query.

```shell
http --raw "Bike for city commuting" :8080/search/simple
```
